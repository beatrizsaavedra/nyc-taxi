New York City Taxi tip prediction


Every month New York City releases data about trips taken in NYC taxis. This data can be found here: (NYC Taxi & Limousine Commission - Trip Record Data, https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page) and is described by the data dictionary (https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/tlc/downloads/pdf/data_dictionary_trip_records_yellow.pdf)

A new ride sharing company is your client. They are looking to start up a rival service to Uber or Lyft in NYC and are interested in using the Taxi Data to get insight into the transportation sector in New York. They have tasked you to get to know the data and start to build some simple models off of it.
